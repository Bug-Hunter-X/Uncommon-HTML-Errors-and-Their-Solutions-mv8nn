<p>This is a common error in HTML.  It occurs when you have a closing tag that doesn't match the opening tag, such as using <code></p></code> to close a <code><div></code> element.  This will cause the browser to render the page incorrectly and can lead to unexpected behavior.</p><p>Another uncommon error is using attributes incorrectly. For example, using a boolean attribute like <code>disabled</code> with a value (<code>disabled="true"</code>) is redundant and might not work as intended in all browsers.</p><p>Lastly, nesting elements improperly can cause issues. For instance, incorrectly nesting block-level elements like <code>div</code> inside inline elements like <code>span</code> can break the layout and create unexpected results.</p>
